- Transitions for moving between current and target cells, used by follow path behaviour
- New rules for floor and voids in getNeighbours/getPath logic which uses directionality to check validity


- Need a better jump landing animation


Experiment Ideas:

- Find paths between a series of waypoints

- Search for item, pick it up



Grid / cell ideas:

- cells that affect position of model (teleport, conveyor, inc/decrease speed)

- jumping over gaps

- stairs



Design thoughts:

- Test how it could work without using a grid; factory methods create 'nodes' of various types like
  floor, stair, pillar etc. Then we derive the astar path nodes from those 3d node objects. 
  -- How do I work out when to jump to the next node?
  -- How would I work out neighbouring nodes?
