Stairs & multiple height levels:
1 - pathfinder getNeighbours needs to take into account the height levels of neighbour cells
  -- should only be able to step up/down in increments of .2

2 - introduce falling from any height
  -- a lower neighbour is always valid
  -- need to have a fall transition, choose between walk & fall based on height diff of start & end
  




Animations:
- falling
- crouch forward strafe 


Navigation:
- crouch walk transition
- climb/drop transition


Interaction:
- button press
- pick up
- carry

Logic/Goals:



NOTES:

- Cell Transitions should define their own logic for when they are finished rather than checking distance
  to the end cell. E.g it may need to wait for an animation to finish.

- If I auto enter Idle/some anim from JumpEnd, I may need to:

    if (currentActionName === AnimationAsset.JumpEnd) {
          this.currentAction?.stop();
          nextAction.play();
        }


New assets todo:

- Merge in new assets branch now that I know it works. Remove all old assets stuff.

- Replace Experiments with Scenes. There will be at most 2 scenes; the main one, and a tester one.

- Lose the grid system. Placing objects in the scene and creating path nodes are separate systems,
  albeit somewhat linked. Perhaps do something similar to my traffic scene road pieces & waypoints.
  Need to keep in mind that I might want to create scenes in blender and export, so the node system 
  should allow for that and be handcraft-able. 

- Debug mode for path nodes so I can ensure it's made correctly.

- Back to basics; square grid of floor tiles with wandering to start with.
