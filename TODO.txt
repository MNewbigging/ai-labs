Logic/Goals:



NOTES:

- Cell Transitions should define their own logic for when they are finished rather than checking distance
  to the end cell. E.g it may need to wait for an animation to finish.

- If I auto enter Idle/some anim from JumpEnd, I may need to:

    if (currentActionName === AnimationAsset.JumpEnd) {
          this.currentAction?.stop();
          nextAction.play();
        }
